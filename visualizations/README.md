## 📂 Available Visualizations

### 1. **triangle-visual.html** 🔺
**Pattern:** Triangle Inequality (Sorting + Greedy)

**What it shows:**
- Step-by-step sorting visualization
- How to check triplets for valid triangles
- Interactive examples with buttons
- Canvas drawings of actual triangle shapes
- Mathematical proof of why sorting works

**How to use:**
```bash
open visualizations/triangle-visual.html
```

**Related problems:**
- Codility: Triangle
- Pattern: Sorting with custom logic
- Time: O(n log n)

## 🚀 Quick Access

From your toptal-prep directory:

```bash
# Open triangle visualization
open visualizations/triangle-visual.html

# Or open in browser
cd visualizations
open triangle-visual.html
```

## 📝 Request More Visualizations

If you want visualizations for other patterns, ask Claude Code:

```
"Create a visual explanation for [Pattern Name] and add it to visualizations/"
```

**Good candidates for visualization:**
- MEX (Card Flipping) - showing array transformations
- BFS (Tree Distance) - showing graph traversal step-by-step
- Prefix Sums - showing cumulative sum building
- Stack Parsing (XML) - showing stack operations
- Binary Gap - showing binary representation

## 💡 Why Visual Learning Helps

1. **Pattern Recognition** - See the algorithm in action
2. **Edge Cases** - Visualize what happens with different inputs
3. **Debugging** - Compare your mental model with visual reality
4. **Memory** - Visual memory is stronger than text memory
