# Toptal Coding Test Preparation

A comprehensive preparation repository for the Toptal coding screening test, containing pattern guides, practice problems, and Claude Code integration.

## What's Inside

### [toptal.md](toptal.md)
Complete guide to the 9 essential patterns for Toptal screening:
- Array Manipulation (MEX, Triangle Inequality, etc.)
- Prefix/Suffix Sums
- Binary Gap
- Counting Elements
- Greedy Algorithms
- Stack/Queue
- Sorting
- Two Pointers
- BFS + Graph Building

### [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
Your guide to using Claude Code effectively:
- Prompt templates for debugging, code review, and optimization
- Learning strategies for each pattern
- Mock test preparation tips
- Examples of effective AI-assisted learning

## Getting Started

1. **Read the patterns**: Start with [toptal.md](toptal.md) to understand the core algorithms
2. **Practice with guidance**: Use [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) prompt templates to learn effectively
3. **Implement solutions**: Write code for each pattern yourself
4. **Test and debug**: Use Claude Code for hints (not solutions!)
5. **Take mock tests**: Practice under time constraints without AI assistance

## Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a learning-first approach:
- ✅ Use Claude Code to understand concepts and debug
- ✅ Write all code yourself
- ✅ Ask for hints when stuck for 20+ minutes
- ❌ Don't ask for complete solutions
- ❌ Don't use AI during mock tests

## Toptal Test Format

- **3 problems** in 90 minutes
- **All must pass** 100% of test cases
- **Patterns covered**: Typically 2-3 from the 9 core patterns
- **Difficulty**: Similar to Codility lessons

## Study Plan Suggestion

1. **Week 1-2**: Master all 9 patterns (2-3 hours per pattern)
2. **Week 3**: Practice mixed problems, optimize solutions
3. **Week 4**: Take mock tests, review weak areas
4. **Final Week**: Speed practice and edge case review

## Mock Test Strategy

1. Set a 90-minute timer
2. Solve 3 problems without any assistance
3. Review your solutions with Claude Code afterward
4. Identify patterns you struggled with
5. Re-study those patterns

## Resources

- **Codility Lessons**: Practice problems for each pattern
- **This Repository**: Pattern guides and learning strategies
- **Claude Code**: Your coding mentor (use wisely!)

## Tips for Success

1. **Read problems carefully** - Edge cases are often in the description
2. **Start with brute force** - Get something working first
3. **Optimize after correctness** - Don't premature optimize
4. **Test edge cases** - Empty arrays, single elements, duplicates
5. **Watch time complexity** - N ≤ 100,000 typically requires O(n) or O(n log n)

## Progress Tracking

Create a checklist to track your mastery:

- [ ] MEX (Minimum Excluded Value)
- [ ] Triangle Inequality
- [ ] Binary Gap
- [ ] Prefix/Suffix Sums
- [ ] Counting Elements
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Stack/Queue
- [ ] Two Pointers
- [ ] BFS + Graph Building

## Contributing to Your Learning

As you practice:
1. Add your solutions to a `solutions/` folder
2. Document tricky edge cases you encountered
3. Note optimization insights
4. Track your mock test scores

## Good Luck!

Remember: The goal isn't just to pass Toptal - it's to become a better problem solver. Take your time, understand deeply, and the test will be easy.

Happy coding! 🚀
