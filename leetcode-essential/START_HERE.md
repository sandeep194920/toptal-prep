## 💡 How to Use These Files

### For Each Problem:

1. **Read** (3-5 min)
   - Understand the problem
   - Look at examples
   - Note constraints

2. **Plan** (5-10 min)
   - Think about approach
   - Write pseudocode in comments
   - Verify complexity targets

3. **Code** (15-30 min)
   - Implement in the TODO section
   - Follow the hints if stuck

4. **Test** (5 min)
   - Run the file: `node lc102-binary-tree-level-order.js`
   - All tests should pass

5. **Review** (5 min)
   - Check if you met time/space complexity
   - Think about edge cases
   - Refactor if needed

## 🤖 How to Use Claude Code While Solving

According to your CLAUDE.md, here's how to get help:

### ✅ GOOD - Ask for help like this:

```
"I'm solving LC 200 (Number of Islands). My approach: use DFS to mark
visited cells. Is this correct? Any edge cases I'm missing?"
```

```
"My LC 102 solution fails test 3. Expected [[1],[2]], Got [[1,2]].
Can you spot the bug? Don't solve it for me."
```

```
"I completed LC 41 (First Missing Positive). Here's my code: [paste]
Can you review for edge cases I might have missed?"
```

### ❌ BAD - Don't ask:

```
"Solve LC 200 for me"
"Write the code for Number of Islands"
"What's the complete solution?"
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Update README.md as you complete problems:

```markdown
**Progress Tracker:** 3/23 completed

## 🎓 Final Tips

1. **Focus on understanding patterns**, not memorizing solutions
2. **Use Claude Code for hints**, not complete answers
3. **Test your code** before marking complete
4. **Practice explaining your approach** out loud
5. **Review CRITICAL problems** multiple times
